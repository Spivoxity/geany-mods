# geany-mods
Latest version of Geany backported to Debian buster, with minor additions.

Here is the source code for a recent version of Geany -- currently 1.37 -- that is able to provide syntax hightlighting for ARM
assembly language with the Gnu syntax.  The package has been slightly modified to allow a longer menu of entries in the
`Build` menu, for use with my Bare Metal micro:bit project.

Packaged releases can be found in a Debian archive at https://spivey.oriel.ox.ac.uk/repos/geany-mods.
